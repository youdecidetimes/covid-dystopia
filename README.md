# About

This is the source code for the [Covid-19 Dystopia](https://youdecidetimes.github.io/covid-dystopia/) website. My goal is to document government overreach throughout the world. I am not suggesting anyone not take precautions, but I fear that many politicians are using Covid-19 to advance their own interests and not to protect the public.
